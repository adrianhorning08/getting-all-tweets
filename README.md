Just put this repo together really quickly, so you'll need to do a little to get it to work ðŸ˜…

You'll have to fix the imports. I just copy and pasted this from my own repo.
You'll have to make a lambda function for `search-api.js`. You'll want this as a lambda function so the IP doesn't get blocked.
You'll have to copy the twitter search api request to insert into `search-api.js`. This is so you use your own cookies and not mine ðŸ˜…
